# IEEETuftsPCBWorkshop
An introductory PCB workshop for the Tufts IEEE club using KiCad 7.0. The basis for this workshop is making a keyboard PCB, following these guides: [Masterzen's Guide](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/03/designing-a-keyboard-part-1/) and [ai03's Guide](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-1---preparations)

By learning how to make this PCB, hopefully one will be able use knowledge for other personal or work projects!
